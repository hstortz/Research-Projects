"""CompLing1 Final Project, Dorothy Kuterbach & Hannah Stortz, SBU Fall 2024

PURPOSE: To rank the active participation of vowels in the Hungarian process of backness harmony.
Statistical analysis intended to determine the consistency of Hungarian vowel harmony,
as well as provide clarity about the status of contested neutral vowels.
Given a vowel inventory, the user will specify vowels for [front]/[back]/[neutral] features.
Prints a table of each vowel, its feature specification, and its percent score in harmony/neutrality.
Also creates a file that contains disharmonic words.
Users can compare results for multiple distributions of vowels/features to determine optimal specification.
Created specifically for analyzing Hungarian backness harmony, but may have applications for other systems of vowel harmony.
